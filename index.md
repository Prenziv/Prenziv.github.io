I'm an incoming PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) studying Electrical Engineering (EE). Previously I graduated from The University of Texas at Dallas with a B.S in EE. My research interests are in neuromorphic computing and analog circuits, specifically how to speed up computations through hardware innovations. Personally I enjoy being outdoors, playing the piano, and playing various video games.
